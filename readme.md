This project was created for extra credit with the permission of the instructor. I also created an assignment document so future students can also solve this assignment.

This game/phenomenon always makes me think about the primordial soup from which our Great Creator molded us :)

You can run a demonstration of this app by downloading and double clicking GameOfLife.jar. Chances are Java is already present on your machine, but if you do not have Java (JRE) installed then you should install it from Oracle's website.

If you run the GameOfLife.jar file from Terminal/Command Prompt, you can use the seed patterns (gospergun.txt) located in the same directory as the .jar file by running "java -jar GameOfLife.jar gospergun.txt"
